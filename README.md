# Stock Portfolio Optimization
This project aims to create an optimal stock portfolio which mirrors the full market, with a smaller number of stocks.

**Input Data**: Daily stock prices for 100 stocks. 

**Outputs**: List of stocks and weights for an optimal portfolio which mirrors the returns of the "full" market (all 100 stocks). Portfolio is customizable to the desired number of stocks (< 100). 
   - **Tracking Error (TE)**: Measures the deviation of the portfolio's returns from the benchmark.
   - **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: Indicates the average magnitude of deviation.
   - Graphical analysis of tracking error and mean absolute deviation across varying constraints (`m`).
